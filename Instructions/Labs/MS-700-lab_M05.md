## **Instructions**

### **Exercise 1: Configure channel and message policies**

In this exercise you will configure policies to manage the creation of new private channels and the available tools for users in chat.

#### Task 1 - Create messaging policy for giphy, memes and stickers

In the past, some users of Contoso have used a lot of stickers, gif animations, and similar pictures in their conversations, even with externals using other chat solutions. The new corporate guideline shall prohibit the use of graphic elements in corporate communication via Teams, because users shall not use them in conversations with external customers and clients. As a Teams service administrator, you must create a new message policy that prohibits its use and apply it to several users of your pilot project.

**Note:** After creating a messaging policy, it can take up to 24 hours for the settings to be applied to the users.

1. Sign in to the **Teams admin center** [**https://admin.teams.microsoft.com**](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/) using **Joni Sherman** (JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com).

2. Create a new **New messaging policy** with the following settings:

	- **Name:** Regular users without fun stuff

	- **Description:** Policy to disable giphys, stickers, and memes in conversations

	- **Use Giphys in conversations:** off

	- **Use Memes in conversations:** off

	- **Use Stickers in conversations:** off

3. Assign the new messaging policy to **Lynne Robbins**.

4. Leave the Teams admin center open.

In this task, you have successfully configured a new messaging policy and assigned it to Lynne Robbins. It will now take some time for the policy to take effect. Continue with the next task.

#### Task 2 - Manage private channels in a team

As Teams administrator of Contoso, you will create a private channel "confidential" in the sales team that only allows some people to be able to access the information.

In the past, users stored data at various locations, including third-party storage providers. Recently, the company deployed OneDrive for all users and would like to guide the users to use SharePoint and OneDrive as the primary data storage locations with Box as an alternative for all file collaborations. As the Teams admin, you are asked to deactivate all third-party storage providers except Box in Microsoft Teams to align with the direction.

**Note:** After disabling the third-party storage provider, it can take up to 24 hours for the settings to be applied to the teams.

In this task, you have successfully created a Power App and integrated it into a Teams channel. All members of the IT-Department team can now use the app in the tab to plan and create an Out of Office (Oof) message for their mailboxes.

### **Exercise 3: Test configured policy settings**

In this exercise, you will test the configured policy settings on a client with the affected user Lynne Robbins and compare the settings to the available client settings of Joni Sherman.
